Tepache

Ingredients
  -   2 whole pineapples
  -  30g ginger*
  - 450g (16oz) brown sugar (or 2 piloncillo pyramids)
  -   2 cinnamon sticks*
  -  10 whole cloves*
  -  10 tamarind pods*
  - ~50oz distilled water

Process
  1. Cut off tops of pineapples, remove rinds.  Cut pineapple into triangular slices.
  2. Add brown sugar and spices with pineapple to large jar.  Shake until brown sugar is mostly dissolved.
  3. Add rest of water and let ferment 7-31 days.  Begin tasting after 7 days and finish per taste.
  4. Bottle and 2F if preferred for carbonation.

Tips:
  - Organic ingredients ferment better
  - Skins and rinds are good in fermentation as they house more natural yeast
  - I highly recommend ginger and cinnamon
  - Hot peppers like habaneros ferment well and can complexify the flavor profile
  *optional per taste
