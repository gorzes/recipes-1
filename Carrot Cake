Process:
  1. Preheat oven to 350F.
  2. Beat (i1) together, mix (i2), stir in (i3), and fold (i4).
  3. Pour batter into a greased and floured 9x13" baking pan.
  4. Bake cake 40-50m until toothpick-done.
  5. Let cake cool 10m in pan then remove to rack to cool completely.
  6. Combine (i5) and beat until creamy; stir in (i6).
  7. Refrigerate slightly (to thicken consistency) and frost cooled cake.

Tips:
  - Use a foil tent and water reservoir in oven during baking.
  - Adding 8oz of crushed pineapple to i3 has been said to be a good addition.
  - Always use room-temp ingredients.
  - You can err lower on the confectioner's sugar if you don't want as much frosting or don't have a very big sweet tooth.
