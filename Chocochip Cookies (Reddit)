Ingredients

 - 270g flour (2c + 2tbsp)
 -   4g baking soda (1tsp)
 -   5g cornstarch (2tsp)
 -   6g salt (1tsp)
 - 170g butter (1.5 sticks)
 - 200g dark brown sugar (1c)
 - 100g granulated sugar (0.5c)
 -   2x large eggs
 -  10mL vanilla extract (2tsp)
 - 260g dark chocolate chips (+) (1.5c)

Process:

 1. Mix flour, baking soda, cornstarch, and salt.  Set aside.
 2. Combine cooled melted butter with the sugars.
 3. Combine eggs and vanilla, beat until just combined.
 4. Slowly combine dry ingredients.  Mix briefly, until clumps are gone.  Fold in chocolate chips.
 5. Cover and refrigerate 30-60 minutes.
 6. Preheat oven to 350F.
 7. Test batch of two cookies: Scoop 1/4 cup of cookie dough at a time and roll into balls. Then, tear the balls in half by pulling gently on both sides. Smush the two halves together again, but this time have the lumpy, torn sides face upward. Place on the prepared baking sheet, making sure the cookies have plenty of space to spread. You should be able to fit 6-8 cookies on each tray.
 8. Bake for about 10-14 minutes, rotating half-way through, or until the cookies have spread out and the edges are golden, but the centers of the cookies still look soft and undercooked.
 9. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets until the cookies are firm enough to remove, about 15 minutes. As the cookies are cooling, press additional chocolate chips into the tops for a more bakery-style look.
